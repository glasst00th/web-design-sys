# web-design-sys
"Build a Web Design System." A pretty lame Codecademy challenge encouraging the developer to display various style choices.
This idea will likely better serve me when I can utilize JS to make it more of an actual "system." Right now it's more of a mock-up of how a few select fonts, colors, and style choices can be used on the page. "Showcase" would likely be a better word.
